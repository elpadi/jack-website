	<div id="why">
		<dt>Why Jack?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p class="dark">I do not know, but ever since i was a kid, i have always liked the name 
			Jack, and why not use this name for a magazine? It is easy and simple to 
			remember, and definitely friendly where no politics or negativity exist, 
			where we embrace all artists and collaborate to create more beauty in 
			this world. Jack magazine has been a labour of love, it started almost 8 
			years ago when i just needed an outlet for expression to create 
			something honest, pure but exciting and fresh, with no limits in all 
			environment from editorial to advertising. I remember while growing 
			up and going to school in England, i came across so many amazing 
			posters on the street that i have tried in vain to take off without 
			damaging the poster during the process, why? so that i can paste it in 
			my study, appreciate while gazing at the artwork, and because it would 
			just make me feel so good. Here and now, i am making this a reality, 
			where one can easily pick Jack up and enjoy the experience.</p>
			<p>Jack’s fans will now be able to collect, experience, display and enjoy 
			Jack’s content, also review, participate and contribute to jack's network 
			of readers and fans. Remember, Jack is all about embracing talented 
			people and contributing to promote art, beauty, film, music, sports, 
			entertainment, good life, health + love.</p>

	<div id="why-me">
		<dt>Why me for Jack?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p class="dark">My name is xxxxxxx, aka Suzi Simona Menouki, some of you already know who
			i am, but i want this to be not about me, but about Jack and the subjects
			Jack embraces, featuring original ideas, collaborating with some of the most
			sort after talented individuals, with no limits and boundaries as to how 
			great the art can be, the final product is Jack.</p>
			<p>I would like to facilitate the start up of such a spark, bringing what i
			know and good into the mix with the best artists and subjects in an environment
			where we will make magic and art - to be presented to the world as Jack.</p>
			<p class="dark">I was born in Asia, lived and schooled in England. My passion is art, 
			drawing and painting became part of my academic repertoire. I speak chinese,
			studied French language at the Sorbonne university in paris, ventured and taken
			part in many mischief while residing in London from posh situation to punk
			environment, and loved every bit of it. I adore the creativity and edge this
			great city brings.</p>
			<p>While growing up, i embrace the idea of not following the masses but rather,
			to learn from them and history, but always stay true and strong as an individual.
			After boarding school, i got accepted to LSE, but decided to travel to the
			United States where i entered the Architectural department at UC Berkeley.</p>
			<p class="dark">After graduation, i came to New York and embark on a wild and crazy journey
			into the world of music, fashion, beauty, entertainment and advertising. i have
			worked in visuals, photography and film with some of the best in the world,
			from make up artists, hair stylists, manicurists, set designers, wardrobe stylists,
			location scouts, producers, assistants … to graphic designers, retouchers,
			printers, art directors, creative directors, CEOS. I have worked with magazines
			such as W, Vanity Fair, New York Times, Detail, interview … to L’oreal, Redken,
			Matrix, Revlon, MAC, Wella, Armani Exchange, Levi’s. I have also worked extensively
			with personalities like Madonna, Beyonce, Jay Z, Prince, Alicia Keys, Mary J,
			Lenny Kravitz, Jennifer Lopes, Snoop dog, Ludacris, Black Crow, Beck, Julie Delpy,
			Rosario Dawson, Mark Ronson, kevin Garnett … Every assignment has been a learning
			experience and my attitude and believe has always been to do my absolute best
			and give every being into the work. Needless to say, i have always dove into every project like it is the last one,
			i want to experience and enjoy the process of this creation and collaboration …
			and nothing has changed here, if anything, only intensified many many folds.</p>
			<p>I get so excited and passionate about the possibilities for Jack, what it can be,
			how Jack will change and influence the world. I believe Jack will be an inspiration
			to anyone who gets a taste of it, where the doors will open and nothing is
			impossible. I will use my knowledge and experience for Jack in ways i could never
			have been able to in the past. Jack’s first premier issue is “ dare to dream “,
			which is what i want for everyone involved in it to explore, and to have the
			audience relate to it. I hope to mix all culture, beauty, philosophy, love and peace together, create a new language … Jack is fresh.</p>
